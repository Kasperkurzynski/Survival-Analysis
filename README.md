# Survival-Analysis
## Survival Analysis performed on "pbcseq" dataset

This analysis uses the pbc dataset from the Survival package. The impact of individual variables is examined, such as age, stage of the disease or symptoms related to the examined disease on the survival of people suffering from primary sclerosing cholangitis. The project was created by three authors and presented to the professor and a group of students. The repository includes a report in html format, code written in the R programming language and code in the R Markdown format.
